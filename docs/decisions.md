# Architecture decisions

Short records of non-obvious choices that the code alone doesn't explain. Reach for this before proposing something that's already been considered and rejected.

This is not a strict ADR template — each entry is a few paragraphs: what we decided, why, and what we traded away. Append new entries to the bottom; don't rewrite history. Date them when you know the date.

## 1. Apple Watch is native Swift / SwiftUI; Wear OS is Flutter

**Decided:** Phase 2 planning (Q1 2026 · see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md))

Flutter's watchOS support is a non-starter for a first-class running computer — the build target isn't stable, the widget tree costs are too high for a small screen under a workout, and the native health frameworks (HealthKit, CoreLocation, WKWorkoutSession) are only reachable through channels we'd have to write ourselves. Swift / SwiftUI / WatchKit is the path everyone else takes and it's the only one that lets the watch run standalone GPS sessions without the phone. Flutter on Wear OS is fine — the Compose interop story is good enough, and the Android team already writes Dart, so we reuse core_models and api_client.

**Trade-off:** We now maintain a second codebase (`apps/watch_ios/`) with its own networking, auth, and Supabase client (`SupabaseService.swift`) that doesn't share anything with the Flutter stack. Acceptable because the watch scope is intentionally small (record + navigate) and the watch mostly relays to the phone.

**Don't re-litigate unless:** Flutter ships a production-ready watchOS target, or Wear OS drops Compose interop support.

## 2. GPS tracks live in Storage, not in `runs.track` jsonb

**Decided:** April 2026 · migration `20260410_001_runs_to_storage.sql`

A 10 km run has ~3,300 GPS points ≈ 265 KB of jsonb per row. At 10 K active users with 200 runs/year that's ~500 GB of database storage, and every dashboard query scans rows bloated with tracks that the dashboard never needs. Moving to object storage (`runs` bucket, path `{user_id}/{run_id}.json.gz`, gzipped) cut per-row size by ~99 %, eliminated jsonb column bloat on the dashboard query path, and let bulk importers (Strava, Health Connect) stay on the $25/month Supabase Pro tier instead of needing Team.

**Shape:** `runs.track_url` column points at the Storage object. Clients lazy-load the track on demand via `ApiClient.fetchTrack` (Dart) or `fetchTrack` in `apps/web/src/lib/data.ts` (TS). The dashboard list view never touches Storage.

**Trade-off:** One extra round trip per run detail view (download + gunzip + JSON parse). Acceptable — detail views are rare compared to dashboard loads.

**Known rough edges** (tracked in `roadmap.md` § "Known issues — runs storage + bulk import"): public `/share/run/{id}` pages can't read tracks because the bucket is private with owner-only RLS; `LocalRunStore.delete` leaks the Storage object; `saveRun` re-uploads the full track on metadata-only edits.

## 3. Custom Dart schema codegen instead of `supadart` / `supabase_codegen`

**Decided:** April 2026 · `scripts/gen_dart_models.dart`

The roadmap's Phase 1 parity-enforcement plan called for evaluating `supadart` or `supabase_codegen` from pub.dev before falling back to a custom script. We skipped the evaluation and went straight to the custom script for two reasons: (1) the schema is tiny (four tables at time of writing), (2) a pub.dev dependency evaluation is an unbounded multi-hour task that was out of proportion to the payoff. A ~260-line parser that handles `create table` / `alter table ... add column` / `alter table ... drop column` is enough for this codebase and adds zero runtime dependencies.

**Trade-off:** The generator's SQL subset is small — it silently ignores indexes, RLS, functions, storage bucket inserts, and `$$...$$` function bodies. Any future migration that relies on an unusual form (a column default calling a subquery, say) will need `gen_dart_models.dart` itself extended before it can be parsed. We get to keep the parser small but we own the failure modes.

**Don't re-litigate unless:** the schema grows past ~15 tables, or a future migration needs a SQL form that would be a non-trivial parser extension.

See [schema_codegen.md](schema_codegen.md) for the full workflow.

## 4. Auto-pause is computed from the saved track, not a live event stream

**Decided:** April 2026 · commit `049b5f5 refactor(android): replace live auto-pause with derived moving time`

The original auto-pause implementation ran during recording — the recorder would flip a "paused" bit when speed dropped below a threshold and stop accumulating distance and duration until movement resumed. That created two problems: (a) the live state was a hidden global that every consumer had to stay in sync with, and (b) the paused/unpaused decision couldn't be revised after the fact. Switching to a post-hoc computation — `movingTimeOf(run)` derives moving time by walking the saved track and dropping segments under the speed threshold — makes the recording pipeline simpler and lets us recompute moving time with different thresholds without re-recording.

**Trade-off:** Live "moving pace" during a run is now approximate — it uses the wall-clock elapsed time, not the eventual moving time, because moving time can't be computed until the track exists. This is acceptable because the runner sees "current pace" which is already a rolling window, not moving pace.

**Applies to:** `packages/run_recorder` and `apps/mobile_android`. The other platforms haven't implemented auto-pause yet.

## 5. Disk-backed tile cache on Android uses `flutter_map_cache` + `dio_cache_interceptor`, not Hive

**Decided:** April 2026 · commit `5fe9b56 feat(android): disk-backed tile cache and test suite`

A persistent tile cache was a "deferred from Phase 1" item. The first pass was in-memory only via `flutter_map_cache`. The disk-backed upgrade uses `dio_cache_interceptor` (already in the Flutter ecosystem, plays nice with `flutter_map`'s network provider) rather than rolling a Hive or sqflite cache from scratch.

**Trade-off:** We depend on `dio_cache_interceptor`'s cache-expiry model rather than owning it ourselves. Fine for now — if we need custom eviction rules (per-style, per-zoom, per-age), we can add a second layer on top.

## 6. `dev` is the working branch; `main` is the PR target

**Decided:** implicit from project setup

All day-to-day work happens on `dev`. PRs merge `dev → main`. Do not push directly to `main`; do not force-push anywhere without being told. Commits on `dev` are fair game; commits on `main` are not amended.

**Why dev?** Lets the user experiment and reset `dev` without disturbing the canonical history on `main`. See the pull-request skill for the PR template.

## 7. Two package managers on purpose: Melos for Flutter, npm workspaces for JS

**Decided:** implicit from project setup

Flutter has its own dependency resolution story and Melos is the idiomatic way to run a multi-package Flutter workspace with pubspec overrides. The web app and the Supabase backend scripts are plain Node / TypeScript and live in npm workspaces declared in the root `package.json` (`apps/web`, `apps/backend`). The two worlds don't share dependencies, so there's no reason to try to unify them.

**Gotcha:** `apps/web` was originally bootstrapped with pnpm (per `apps/web/CLAUDE.md` — still references `pnpm i` / `pnpm dev`). In practice we use npm because that's what the root workspace uses. If you see `pnpm` in an older doc and it doesn't match what CI does, CI is correct.

## 8. Mobile uses `flutter_map` + MapLibre, not native MapLibre SDKs

**Decided:** implicit from the architecture

The native MapLibre SDKs for iOS (maplibre-native) and Android (maplibre-gl-native) are not well-wrapped for Flutter — the existing Flutter bindings are inconsistent and don't support the full style spec. `flutter_map` + a MapLibre-compatible tile source gives us raster tiles today with a clean Flutter API. The web app uses MapLibre GL JS directly because the JS ecosystem is fully featured there.

**Trade-off:** Mobile tiles are raster, web tiles are vector. Mobile can't do the 3D terrain and smooth styling the web route builder has. Users aren't building routes on mobile in Phase 1 anyway (route builder is web-first), so the gap is mostly invisible.

**Don't re-litigate unless:** Flutter's native MapLibre bindings mature, or the mobile app starts needing vector features (pitch, bearing, dynamic styles).

## 9. "Fastest 5k" is a rolling-window scan of the track, not a scaled average

**Decided:** April 2026 · `lib/run_stats.dart#fastestWindowOf` + `dashboard_screen.dart#_best5k`

The original `_best5k` computed `Duration(seconds: (run.duration.inSeconds / run.distanceMetres * 5000).round())` — the overall average pace of any run ≥ 5 km projected onto 5 km. This is fast, deterministic, and completely wrong for any run that isn't paced perfectly evenly: a 10 km in 1:14:34 would display as "Fastest 5k: 37:17" even though the runner never covered 5 km in 37:17 continuously. Users saw a PB they had never actually run.

The fix is `fastestWindowOf(track, 5000)` — a two-pointer sliding-window scan over the waypoints that finds the quickest continuous 5 km anywhere in the track, with linear interpolation at the window boundary so the result isn't quantised to waypoint gaps on sparse tracks. O(n) per run. The dashboard memoises the result in `_best5kCache: Map<String, Duration?>` keyed by run id so a 200-run history only pays the scan cost once per run-store mutation, not once per rebuild.

**Trade-off:** Runs without a GPS track (manual entries, Health Connect summary imports) have no pace data to scan, so they're excluded from "Fastest 5k" entirely — if all your runs lack tracks, the card hides. Better than lying: the old code would silently "project" a 5k PB from a manual run's typed-in distance and duration, which is meaningless.

**Don't re-litigate unless:** a compelling case emerges for showing a PB on manual runs, in which case consider a separate "Best estimated 5k" card rather than mixing the two definitions.

See the regression tests in `apps/mobile_android/test/run_stats_test.dart` — the 37:17 case is checked explicitly.

## 10. Clubs MVP: club-owned events, enum recurrence, open-join

**Decided:** April 2026 · `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20260416_001_clubs_and_events.sql`

Three branch points in the social-layer design, all resolved the simpler way on purpose:

1. **Club-owned events only** (not standalone meetups). Every event has a non-null `club_id`. Standalone "public meetup" events were considered and rejected for v1 — they'd require a second visibility/RLS path and we haven't seen the need. A user who wants a standalone event creates a solo club for it.
2. **Enum recurrence, not RRULE** (Phase 2, not yet shipped). `weekly` / `biweekly` / `monthly` + `byday[]` + `until_date` covers ~95% of running-club schedules ("Sunday long run", "Tuesday speed work") at about 10% of the implementation cost of RFC 5545. Materialised instances on read, not on write, so shifting a recurring event is a single row update.
3. **Open-join in v1**, with request-to-join deferred to Phase 2. A boolean `is_public` gates club visibility and discovery. Private clubs are reachable only by slug + membership — no invite link yet. `join_club` just inserts a `club_members` row; no approval surface.

**Trade-off:** Scope creep is the main risk the simple defaults protect against. If a future user really wants a standalone meetup, we can lift the `club_id` constraint and add a `visibility` column without breaking anything. If someone really needs RFC 5545 recurrence (e.g. "last Tuesday of every month except August"), we grow the parser or swap in an `rrule` column — again, additive.

**Don't re-litigate unless:** (a) users ask for meetups that aren't tied to any club (common enough to justify a second RLS path), or (b) a concrete club's schedule can't be expressed with the enum + `byday` + `until_date` model.

Schema + RLS details in `api_database.md`, surfaces in `clubs.md`, phased rollout in `roadmap.md § Clubs and events`.

## How to add an entry

1. Append below, numbered in sequence.
2. Lead with what was decided, then *why*, then the *trade-off*, then when not to re-litigate.
3. Cite the migration, commit, or PR that captures it if there is one.
4. Keep it short — one screen or less. If it's longer than that, it probably belongs in `architecture.md` or its own deep-dive doc, with a pointer from here.
