# Bootstrap stack — creates the Terraform state bucket that every
# other stack uses as its remote backend.
#
# Run ONCE per AWS account, with local state. After `terraform apply`,
# the other stacks (`dns`, `github-oidc`, `envs/*`) configure their
# `backend.tf` to point at the bucket created here.
#
# State locking uses S3-native conditional writes (`use_lockfile =
# true` in each backend block) — supported by every stack since
# Terraform 1.10. No DynamoDB table is required.
#
# This stack is the only one that uses local state; everyone else
# uses remote state. Do NOT migrate this stack's own state into the
# bucket it creates — that's a chicken-and-egg situation.
